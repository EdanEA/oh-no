# Oh no!
## What is `Oh no!`?
`Oh no!` is a Discord bot that parses messages for emojis and then reacts to the aforementioned message with those the parsed emojis.

## How is this witchcraft done?
It's quite literally a long RegEx that parses for unicode emojis, as well as Discord's custom emoji syntax. This RegEx is tested upon newly created messages, then all of what is parsed is added to the message's reactions.

## Okay.
Alright. **:^)**
